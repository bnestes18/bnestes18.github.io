                        <p>WELCOME</p>
                        <p>After my freshmen year in high school, I knew exactly what I wanted to be. Simply stated, I want to be able to create and improve products that will help society. After all, what is living truly all about if we are not trying to make the world the best place it can be? Being an ambitious and aspiring Computer Engineer will give me the opportunity to develop ways to enhance the life of others from a more intellectual aspect. I am tech-savvy, driven, and eager to demonstrate my technical acumen with a creative and technology-oriented company in an environment that encourages innovative thinking and career development. My passions include nerd-like activities such as rebuilding old hardware projects and learning new software languages at my own leisure.</p>
